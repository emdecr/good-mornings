# Good Mornings
## API App â€“ HackerYou Week 5 Project

This is the app I created for Week 5 of [HackerYou](http://hackeryou.com/)'s Full-time Front-End Bootcamp <3 #the6ix

**Good Mornings** is all about starting off your day feeling inspired. I love TED Talks and books, so I decided to combine the two. Type a topic into the search field, press enter, and a few TED Talks will appear, as well as some books that relate (in varying degrees) to them.
